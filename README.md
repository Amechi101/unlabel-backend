## Master Module
This module contains the dashboard that controls the entire application. Anyone can be given access to login into the master module if they are made superusers. The master module as well has two **sub modules** called brand module & influencer module. 

## Sub Modules
Sub modules contain global/specific settings & data models. Each of the sub modules have the ability to generate links to create **Sub module components**. 
- Sub modules contain specific settings that apply to the individual module only.
- Sub modules have shared settings that apply to both modules.
- Sub modules contain data models that apply to the individual module only.
- Sub modules have shared data models that apply to both modules.

### Sub Module components:
Sub modules componets are made from the sub module brand or influencer. They are essentially mini applications that has a dashboard. They are created from their respective sub modulues and house data for brands or influencers which in turn is then stored in our database. Each component has an internal API that links to the root sub module.
